    <section>
        <p>01101 was made back in 20 20s of 4. 
            It grown from simple replit site to simple github repo. 
            The project is a culmination of a few school asignments from the WebDeb clas are Merit Prep Acmd. 
            Eventualy we got sick of sufferage on Replit and moved over to Github. 
            Replit has been implementing not cool stuff. 
            The new 01101 is well structured and organised via the <code>-Projects</code> folder. 
            The project is a simple site that is a collection of our work from both within the projects requirements, and from without.
            <hr><br>
            The project includes the Bean Pages, the Degree Clock, the Documentation, the Financial Tools, 
            Lukes Pages, the Nasty ai pages, the New Index, old index, our final final school project, Tower of Gable Web Edition, and a few other pages that just help the user get around. (such as index+old index, -project_linker, nasty linkers 1 and 2, the readme and some other stuff.)

  <h1>Precision Orbital Delivery System™ (PODS™)</h1>
  <p>
    At <strong>Orbital Logistics Unlimited™</strong>, we don’t just deliver packages—we redefine what delivery means.
    Through the groundbreaking capabilities of our Precision Orbital Delivery System™ (PODS™), your package will
    reach your doorstep faster, safer, and more spectacularly than ever thought possible.
  </p>
  <h2>The Journey: Science in Every Second™</h2>
  <p>
    When you place an order, PODS™ doesn’t simply "ship" your package—no, it embarks on a scientifically orchestrated
    journey.
    First, our patented **Intercontinental Package Acceleration Launch (IPAL) System™** propels the delivery missile
    from one
    of our geostationary launch hubs, achieving Mach 5.6 within 7.8 seconds. From there, the package enters its initial
    ballistic phase, during which its trajectory is continuously recalibrated to account for gravitational curvature,
    wind shear, and minor inconveniences like commercial airline traffic.
  </p>
  <p>
    The precise arc of travel is modeled using the integral:
  </p>
  <div class="highlight">
    d = ∫<sub>t₀</sub><sup>t<sub>f</sub></sup> √(v<sub>x</sub>²(t) + v<sub>y</sub>²(t) + v<sub>z</sub>²(t)) dt
  </div>
  <p>
    Here, \(v_x(t)\), \(v_y(t)\), and \(v_z(t)\) represent velocity components derived from over 3,842 individual
    telemetry sensors
    strategically positioned on the delivery vehicle. Gravitational acceleration (\(g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2\)) and wind
    resistance
    (calculated via proprietary extensions to the Navier-Stokes equations) are all factored into every microsecond of
    flight.
  </p>
  <h2>Why Stop at Earth?™</h2>
  <p>
    Upon entering the terminal descent phase—aptly named the **Atmospheric Package Precision Adjustment Dive™
    (APPAD™)**—PODS™
    autonomously corrects its angle of attack, ensuring that your package doesn’t just arrive near your doorstep but
    within
    a radius of 0.02 meters. Yes, that’s less than the diameter of your average house cat. At Orbital Logistics
    Unlimited™,
    we understand the stakes of package placement and refuse to accept even a millimeter of error.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our descent timing is modeled by solving second-order differential equations of motion:
  </p>
  <div class="highlight">
    d²x/dt² = -(1/2) C<sub>d</sub> ρ A (dx/dt)² + F<sub>g</sub>
  </div>
  <p>
    In layman’s terms? Our drag coefficient (\(C_d\)), atmospheric density (\(ρ\)), and gravitational forces (\(F_g = m
    \cdot g\))
    ensure that your package gently transitions from hypersonic speeds to a soft, parachute-free landing.
    (Why parachutes when you have math?)
  </p>
  <h2>Fast. Safe. Math-Powered.™</h2>
  <p>
    Picture this: You’ve ordered your favorite limited-edition collectible toaster, and it’s 1,234,567 meters away.
    At Mach 5.6, PODS™ calculates the time-to-arrival as precisely <strong>285.92 seconds</strong>, including time for
    atmospheric braking.
    Our systems don’t just calculate—they anticipate, adapt, and dominate the delivery landscape.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through PODS™, we’ve turned delivery into an art form, combining advanced physics, military-grade precision,
    and just a hint of audacity to ensure you never wait for your packages again.

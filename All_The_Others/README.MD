# Project Structure Guidelines

When starting a new project, **organization is key**. Here's how to set it up:

## 1. Create a New Folder
- **Keep names concise.**
- This folder serves as the **root directory** for all project files.

**Example:**  
`/011001/All_The_Others/Your_Project_Name `

## 2. Organize Your Content
- Place **all project-related files** and folders inside the new folder.
- **Maintain separation** of different aspects of your project by categorizing files into subfolders (e.g., code, assets, documentation).

## 3. Use a README File
- Every project folder should have a **README.md** file to provide an overview of the project.
- This file should explain the projectâ€™s structure, purpose, and usage.

## Summary
- **Create a folder with a straightforward, short name.**
- This approach **ensures clarity and ease of navigation** as 01101 grows.

Happy coding!
